### Arduino Wireless Network with NRF24L01 Modules
This project utilizes Arduino and NRF24L01 transceiver modules to establish a wireless network capable of transmitting and receiving data within a range of up to 100 meters in open areas. The NRF24L01 modules support a high data rate of 2Mbps and operate within the 2.4 GHz frequency band, ensuring low interference.

#### Components:
- Arduino Uno
- NRF24L01 modules
- Potentiometer
- Servo motor

### Future Work
### Predictive Maintenance
  Description : Implement a predictive maintenance system using sensor data. By monitoring various parameters like temperature, vibration, or current, ML algorithms can predict potential failures before they occur.

### Steps:
- Collect Data from Relevant Sensors: Set up and gather data from sensors.
- Train a Predictive Maintenance Model: Use Python and ML libraries to train a model on the collected data.
- Deploy the Model to the Arduino: Convert the model to a suitable format and load it onto the Arduino for real-time maintenance alerts.
